## Background

The Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) product suite is designed to collect data from satellite radar and optical instruments to generate three products:

- a near-global Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWx) product suite
- a near-global land-surface Disturbance (DIST) product suite
- a North America land-surface Displacement (DISP) product suite

Only DSWx products will be distributed through PO.DAAC. More information can be found on [PO.DAAC's OPERA webpage](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/OPERA).
