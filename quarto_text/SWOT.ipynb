        "The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission aims to provide valuable data and information about the world's oceans and its terrestrial surface water such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands. SWOT is being developed jointly by NASA and Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA). The mission is targeted to launch in December 2022. PO.DAAC is the NASA archive for the SWOT mission, and once launched will be making data available via the NASA Earthdata Cloud (hosted in AWS) with direct download capabilities still available.\n",

Before these SWOT products are available, we have [SWOT simulated datasets](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT?tab=datasets&sections=about%2Bdata) encompassing both oceanography and hydrology sample data. This data is not for analysis, but rather to become comfortable with future SWOT products data formats and access mechanisms.\n",
