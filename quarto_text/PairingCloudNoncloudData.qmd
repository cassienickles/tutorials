title: Pairing Cloud and Non-cloud Data
---

Tutorials highlighting workflows that utilize both cloud and non-cloud data simultaneously.

### Example: River Heights Comparison

This tutorial explores the relationships between satellite and in situ river heights in the Mississippi River using Pre-SWOT MEaSUREs and USGS river height gauges.

### Example: Ocean Satellite & In-situ Comparison

This tutorial co-locates in-situ measurements and satellite data of sea surface temperature (SST) near the European coast for cross-validation of data or model validation. Datasets: Argo floats, MODIS-Aqua L2 SST, & MUR L4 SST.
