title: Cloud vs. Local Workflows
---

Tutorials showcasing the same workflows in in different locations: in the cloud hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) or on a local machine downloaded from the cloud. 

Note: NASA Earthdata is hosted in the `us-west-2` region in the cloud.

### Example: Amazon Estuary Exploration

These tutorials explore the relationships between land water equivalent thickness, river height, sea surface salinity, and sea surface temperature in the Amazon River estuary and coastal region from multiple datasets (GRACE-FO, Pre-SWOT MEaSUREs, OISSS, & MODIS).

### Example: Reservoir Surface Area

These tutorials estimate reservoir surface area from Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel (HLS) Imagery.
