If you have [cloned the PO.DAAC tutorials GitHub repository](TechGuides.qmd#cloning-this-github-repository) with all of the PO.DAAC Cookbook Notebooks, you can make changes on your copy of the tutorials and then create a pull request that will be reviewed by our team to potentially add your content. Follow [these intructions on how to create a pull request in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).\n\nAdded content will only be accepted if it follows these guidlines:\n\n- For Jupyter Notebook Tutorials, follow [this template](../notebooks/Tutorials_TEMPLATE.ipynb) as a standard.\n- For tutorials outside of Jupyter Notebooks, the format must have the following sections: `add sections from above template`\n- The tutorial must be tested successfully and reviewed by a PO.DAAC member non-author. (This will be done before merging the pull request.)\n\n## Instructions for PO.DAAC Contributors *- in progress, coming soon*\n\n### Cookbook Structure\n\nThe PO.DAAC Cookbook is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). To build this particular Quarto book, we used [these instructions](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/) from NASA Openscapes. It's a Quarto book tutorial on how to copy (fork or download) an existing Quarto website like this one and adapt it for your own uses. \n \n### Setting up your Work Station\n\nAdmittedly, there are many ways to set up your work station to effectively accomplish contributing to or editing the PO.DAAC Cookbook quarto website. The following are my (Cassie's) methods that I have found to be the most effective for me. \n\n**1. Creat a GitHub Account** - If you do not have one already, create a GitHub account here: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). \n\n**2. Join a team on the podaac repository** - Once you have a GitHub account, in the podaac repository, request to join the PO.DAAC team that best suits your position [here](https://github.com/orgs/podaac/teams). This will give you the permissions required to contribute as a PO.DAAC Member.\n\n**3. Set Up your Coding Workspace** - On a local machine, I tend to deploy [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install) (where I do most of my coding) from [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/index.html). RStudio, VS Code, etc. could also work, depending on which you prefer. The workflow would also work on a cloud environment, where I also tend to use the Jupyter Lab interface.\n\n**4. Install Quarto** - download and install [Quarto's latest version here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).\n\n**5. Pick your Prefered Method to Interface with GitHub in your Workspace** - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) makes it easy for me to track my changes and create Pull Requests without needing to remember commands in a the command line interface. If you prefer to use the command line, this is a comprehensive and maintained [list of git commands](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules) that may be useful.\n\n**6. Clone the podaac/tutorials GitHub Repository** - Instructions to do this are in the [Tech Guides Section](TechGuides.qmd#cloning-this-github-repository) of this Cookbook. I usually use GitHub Desktop.\n\n**7. If you've completed the above, you should have all the necessary ingredients to contribute to the PO.DAAC Cookbook!**\n\n### How to Add/Edit Written Cookbook Content\n\n**1. Create a New Branch in GitHub** - Creating a new branch is important so changes are made on a separate location than the main branch that everyone can work on at the same time. It helps to have your own branch to work on (named however you like) to make changes and then merge those changes on the master branch after changes are done. When merged, it is common practice to delete the created branch. I like to create a new branch from GitHub Desktop like so:\n\n![](../images/GitHub_Desktop_New_Branch.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshots of how to create a New Branch Using GitHub Desktop\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"80%\"}\n\n**2. Navigate to the tutorials folder in your Coding Workspace**\n\n - Tips for previewing! add quarto preview instructions\n - format for Dataset Specific Examples\n\n### How to Add Tutorials\n\nAdding tutorials as a PO.DAAC Contributor should follow the same instructions as those outside of PO.DAAC. See [above](Contribute.qmd#make-suggestions-or-add-tutorials).\n\n## Questions about the contribute process? \n\nCreate an issue on our [tutorials Issues GitHub page](https://github.com/podaac/tutorials/issues).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../include-files.lua","quarto"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Contribute.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":{"light":"cosmo","dark":"darkly"},"code-copy":true,"title":"Contribute"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
