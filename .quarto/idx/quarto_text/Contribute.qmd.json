If you have [cloned the PO.DAAC tutorials GitHub repository](TechGuides.qmd#cloning-this-github-repository) with all of the PO.DAAC Cookbook Notebooks, you can make changes on your copy of the tutorials and then create a pull request that will be reviewed by our team to potentially add your content. Follow [these intructions on how to create a pull request in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).\n\nAdded content will only be accepted if it follows these guidlines:\n\n- For Jupyter Notebook Tutorials, follow [this template](../notebooks/Tutorials_TEMPLATE.ipynb) as a standard.\n- For tutorials outside of Jupyter Notebooks, the format must have the following sections: `add sections from above template`\n- The tutorial must be tested successfully and reviewed by a PO.DAAC member non-author. (This will be done before merging the pull request.)\n\n## Instructions for PO.DAAC Contributors *- in progress, coming soon*\n\n#### Cookbook Structure\n\nThe PO.DAAC Cookbook is built using a package called \"Quarto\"\n \n#### Setting up your Work Station\n\nAdmittedly, there are many ways to set up your work station to effectively accomplish contributing to or editing the PO.DAAC Cookbook quarto book. The following are my (Cassie's) methods that I have found to be the most effective for me interfacing with GitHub, etc. \n\n1. If you do not have one already, create a GitHub account here: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). Once you have an account, in the podaac repository, request to join the PO.DAAC team that best suits your position [here](https://github.com/orgs/podaac/teams). This will give you the permissions required to contribute as a PO.DAAC Member.\n2. anaconda for python\n - install quarto\n - GitHub Desktop\n - clone the repo\n - You will be able to incorporate this setup into a local workflow (with Jupyter Lab, VS Code, RStudio, etc) or in a cloud environment. I use Jupyter Lab most often.\n - quarto preview\n\n\n#### How to Add/Edit Written Cookbook Content\n\n - Tips for previewing! add quarto preview instructions\n - format for Dataset Specific Examples\n\n#### How to Add Tutorials\n\nAdding tutorials as a PO.DAAC Contributor should follow the same instructions as those outside of PO.DAAC. See [above](Contribute.qmd#make-suggestions-or-add-tutorials).\n\n## Questions about the contribute process? \n\nCreate an issue on our [tutorials Issues GitHub page](https://github.com/podaac/tutorials/issues).\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../include-files.lua","quarto"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Contribute.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":{"light":"cosmo","dark":"darkly"},"code-copy":true,"title":"Contribute"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
