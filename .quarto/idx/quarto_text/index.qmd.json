Our goal is to make NASA’s ocean, climate, and surface water data universally accessible and meaningful.\n\n*This site is under active, open development. Stay tuned for more and ever-evolving content!*\n\n\n## About the Cookbook\n\nThe PO.DAAC Cookbook is a place to learn about & experiment with the NASA Earthdata datasets we host. All data can be accessed freely in the cloud or downloaded locally. The **How To** section gives bite-sized pieces of code created in collaboration with the [NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/) community. **Tutorials** connect these pieces together to form example workflows specific to PO.DAAC datasets both within the cloud and on a local machine. To learn more about the cloud specifically, see the [Earthdata Cloud Primer](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/user-resources/webinars-and-tutorials/cloud-primer.) \n\nMost tutorials included in this cookbook are created with Python Jupyter Notebooks. All chapters in the cookbook are a combination of narrative, links, code, and outputs — and underlying each chapter is a file type that you can access on [PO.DAAC GitHub](https://github.com/podaac/tutorials) (linked on the left navbar and right margin of each page): Jupyter (.ipynb) or Quarto (.qmd) files.\n\n## About PO.DAAC\n\nThe Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC) is a NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System ([EOSDIS](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis)) data center managed by the Earth Science Data and Information System ([ESDIS](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds)) Project. The PO.DAAC is operated by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../include-files.lua","quarto"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":{"light":["cosmo","theme.scss"],"dark":["cosmo","theme-dark.scss"]},"code-copy":true,"title":"PO.DAAC Cookbook","subtitle":"Making complex data simple with a few helpful tutorials"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
