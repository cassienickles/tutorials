SWOT is being developed jointly by NASA and Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA). The satellite launched on December 16, 2022 and data is expected to be released to the public no earlier than Fall 2023. PO.DAAC is the NASA archive for the SWOT mission, and will be making data available via the NASA Earthdata Cloud (hosted in AWS) with direct download capabilities available.\n\n![More information can be found on [PO.DAAC's SWOT webpage](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT).](../images/podaac_swot_landing_page.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of PO.DAAC's SWOT landing page\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"80%\"}\n\nPO.DAAC will host a variety of [SWOT data products](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT?tab=datasets). Their product description documents can be found in the chart listing each dataset. Before these SWOT products are available, we have [SWOT simulated datasets](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT?tab=datasets&sections=about%2Bdata) encompassing both oceanography and hydrology sample data. This data is not for analysis, but rather to become comfortable with future SWOT products data formats and access mechanisms.\n\n## SWOT Data Resources & Tutorials\n\n### Search \n\nFind/download [simulated SWOT data on Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=simulated%20swot)\n\n[Search programmatically with unique SWORD river reach ID](../notebooks/SWORD_River_Demo.ipynb)\n\n[Search programmatically with unique Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) basin ID](../notebooks/HUC Feature Translation Service Examples-updated-20210804.ipynb)\n\n### Download/Subscribe\n\nPO.DAAC subscriber/downloader examples in the command line: \n\nHydrology: *These examples will download either the river vector files or the raster files for a location in Texas with multiple passes:* \n```\npodaac-data-downloader -c SWOT_SIMULATED_NA_CONTINENT_L2_HR_RiverSP_V1 -d ./SWOT_SIMULATED_NA_CONTINENT_L2_HR_RiverSP_V1 -start-date 2022-08-02T00:00:00Z --end-date 2022-08-22T00:00:00Z -b=\"-97,32.5,-96.5,33\"\n```\n    \n```\npodaac-data-downloader -c SWOT_SIMULATED_NA_CONTINENT_L2_HR_Raster_V1 -d ./SWOT_SIMULATED_NA_CONTINENT_L2_HR_Raster_V1 --start-date 2022-08-02T00:00:00Z --end-date 2022-08-22T00:00:00Z -b=\"-97,32.5,-96.5,33\"\n```\n\nOceanography: *This example will download modeled sea surface heights:*\n    \n```\npodaac-data-subscriber -c SWOT_SIMULATED_L2_KARIN_SSH_GLORYS_CALVAL_V1 -d ./data/SWOT_SIMULATED_L2_KARIN_SSH_GLORYS_CALVAL_V1 --start-date 2015-12-30T00:00:00Z\n```\n\n```\npodaac-data-downloader -c SWOT_SIMULATED_L2_NADIR_SSH_ECCO_LLC4320_SCIENCE_V1 -d ./data/SWOT_SIMULATED_L2_NADIR_SSH_ECCO_LLC4320_SCIENCE_V1 --start-date 2011-11-20T00:00:00Z --end-date 2011-11-20T12:00:00Z\n```\n\n> For more information, see [https://github.com/podaac/data-subscriber](https://github.com/podaac/data-subscriber)\n\n\n### In-cloud Access\n\n[Access sample SWOT Hydrology data in the cloud](../notebooks/meetings_workshops/swot_ea_workshop_sept2022/SWOTHR_s3Access.ipynb)\n\n[Access sample SWOT Oceanography data in the cloud](../external/Direct_Access_SWOT_sim_Oceanography.ipynb)\n\n### GIS workflows\n\n[GIS shapefile exploration](../notebooks/GIS/SWOTsample_GISshapefiles.ipynb)\n\n### Transform\n\n[Transform SWOT Hydrology river reach shapefiles into time series](../notebooks/GIS/SWOTsample_CSVconversion.ipynb) - *This tutorial is in development*\n\nSubset by bounding box - *Experimental* - *coming soon*\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n### 2022 SWOT Ocean Cloud Workshop\n\n[**https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/**](https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/){.uri}\n\nThe goal of the workshop was to enable the (oceanography) science team to be ready for processing and handling the large volumes of SWOT SSH data in the cloud.
