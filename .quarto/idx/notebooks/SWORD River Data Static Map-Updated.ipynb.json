We then use geospatial coordinates of the features (here river reaches/node along the Kasai River, a tributary of the Congo River in Africa) to query against a dataset in CMR, namely Pre SWOT Hydrology.\n\n**Resources**\n- SWOT River Database (SWORD) data can be found here: https://zenodo.org/record/4917236#.YTKLPd9lCST\n- Other SWOT SWORD documentation can be found here: https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/4031/\n- MEaSUREs - Pre-Surface Water and Ocean Topography (Pre-SWOT) Hydrology data can be found here: https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/MEaSUREs-Pre-SWOT?sections=data\n\n### Required Dependencies\n\nThere are three python dependencies that must be available to the python kernel running this notebook. \n\n- plotly (https://pypi.org/project/plotly/)\n- kaleido (https://pypi.org/project/kaleido/)\n- geojson (https://pypi.org/project/geojson/)\n\nThe next cell installs them when the cell is run.\n\nFirst, we define a function to query the FTS service for a single reach, multiple reaches, or river nodes. This function returns the properties of river reaches including name, length, coordinates as well as individual node properties.\n\nWe define another function to calculate the center coordinates of features. This function returns the center of a single reach or multiple reaches. \n\n# Plot a Single River Reach\n\nIn this section, we query the FTS SWORD service using a single Reach ID (from SWORD). In this example, we use the river Reach ID `13227000061`. This ID represents a specific reach along the Kasai River, a tributary of the Congo River in Africa. \n\nNow we can plot this reach and calculate  the center of the reach.\n\nThe below cell plots the river reach using an interactive map. You can zoom out to see where the reach is located.\n\n# Plot Multiple River Reaches\n\nIn this section, we query the FTS SWORD service over multiple river reaches. In this example, we use ID `132270000`. This ID represents multiple reaches along the Kasai River, a tributary of the Congo River in Africa. Note that this reach includes the reach ID of `13227000061` we plotted earlier. The response includes 9 individual reaches.\n\nNow we can plot these multiple reaches and calculate  the center of the features.\n\nThe below cell plots the river reaches using an interactive map. You can zoom out to see where these reaches are located.\n\n# Plot River Nodes\n\nIn this section, we query the FTS SWORD service for river nodes. In this example, we use the ID of  `13227000060`. Note that this ID corresponds to the same reach ID `13227000061` we used earlier. The only difference is that the last digit of `0` corresponds to all the individual *nodes* along the reach. If the last digit is `1` in the reach ID, it corresponds to the overall properties of the *reach* itself. The response returns 52 nodes along the reach.\n\nNow we can plot the river nodes and calculate the center of the nodes.\n\n## Query CMR by Coordinates\n\nHere is a another useful example of the Feature Translation Service. We can use results obtained from the FTS to then directly and automatically query data using CMR. We will use the coordinate information of a single reach to search for granules available through the [Pre SWOT Hydrology GRRATS Daily River Heights](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/PRESWOT_HYDRO_GRRATS_L2_DAILY_VIRTUAL_STATION_HEIGHTS_V2) and Storage Version 2 data. \n\nWe query CMR using the previously used reach ID of `13227000061` over Kasai River, a tributary of the Congo River in Africa.\n\nThe next cell queries CMR using the coordinates of the reach. Note that coordinates should be listed in the format lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2, lon3, lat3, and so on. The CMR json response proivides a link to the data file (granule) from the Pre SWOT Hydroology GRRATS Daily River Heights data collection that overlaps the geospatial search from FTS-SWORD for the river reaches of interest, e.g. `\"href\": \"https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/preswot_hydrology/L2/rivers/daily//Africa_Congo1kmdaily.nc\"`\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../include-files.lua","quarto"],"toc":true,"output-file":"SWORD River Data Static Map-Updated.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":{"light":"cosmo","dark":"darkly"},"code-copy":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
