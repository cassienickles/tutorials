It downloads granules the ingested since the previous run to a designated data folder and overwrites a hidden file inside with the timestamp of the CMR Search request on success.\n\n## Before you start\n\nBefore you beginning this tutorial, make sure you have an Earthdata account: [https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov) for the operations envionrment (most common) or [https://uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov](https://uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov) for the UAT environment.\n\nAccounts are free to create and take just a moment to set up.\n\n## Authentication setup\n\nWe need some boilerplate up front to log in to Earthdata Login.  The function below will allow Python\nscripts to log into any Earthdata Login application programmatically.  To avoid being prompted for\ncredentials every time you run and also allow clients such as curl to log in, you can add the following\nto a `.netrc` (`_netrc` on Windows) file in your home directory:\n\n```\nmachine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov\n    login <your username>\n    password <your password>\n```\n\nMake sure that this file is only readable by the current user or you will receive an error stating\n\"netrc access too permissive.\"\n\n`$ chmod 0600 ~/.netrc` \n\n*You'll need to authenticate using the netrc method when running from command line with [`papermill`](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You can log in manually by executing the cell below when running in the notebook client in your browser.*\n\n## Hands-off workflow\n\nThis workflow/notebook can be run routinely to maintain a time series of NRT data, downloading new granules as they become available in CMR. \n\nThe notebook writes/overwrites a file `.update` to the target data directory with each successful run. The file tracks to date and time of the most recent update to the time series of NRT granules using a timestamp in the format `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ`. \n\nThe timestamp matches the value used for the [`created_at`](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html#g-created-at) parameter in the last successful run. This parameter finds the granules created within a range of datetimes. This workflow leverages the `created_at` parameter to search backwards in time for new granules ingested between the time of our timestamp and now.\n\nThe variables in the cell below determine the workflow behavior on its initial run:\n\n* `mins`: Initialize a new local time series by starting with the granules ingested since ___ minutes ago. \n* `cmr`: The domain of the target CMR instance, either `cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov` or `cmr.uat.earthdata.nasa.gov`.\n* `ccid`: The unique CMR `concept-id` of the desired collection.\n* `data`: The path to a local directory in which to download/maintain a copy of the NRT granule time series.\n\nThe variable `data` is pointed at a nearby folder [`resources/nrt`](resources/nrt/) by default. **You should change `data` to a suitable download path on your file system.** An unlucky sequence of git commands could disappear that folder and its downloads if your not careful. Just change it.\n\nThe Python imports relevant to the workflow\n\n**The search retrieves granules ingested during the last `n` minutes.** A file in your local data dir  file that tracks updates to your data directory, if one file exists. The CMR Search falls back on the ten minute window if not.\n\nThis cell will replace the timestamp above with the one read from the `.update` file in the data directory, if it exists.\n\nThere are several ways to query for CMR updates that occured during a given timeframe. Read on in the CMR Search documentation:\n\n* https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html#c-with-new-granules (Collections)\n* https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html#c-with-revised-granules (Collections)\n* https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html#g-production-date (Granules)\n* https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html#g-created-at (Granules)\n\nThe `created_at` parameter works for our purposes. It's a granule search parameter that returns the records ingested since the input timestamp.\n\nGet the query parameters as a string and then the complete search url:\n\nGet a new timestamp that represents the UTC time of the search. Then download the records in `umm_json` format for granules that match our search parameters:\n\nNeatly print the first granule record (if one was returned):\n\nThe link for http access can be retrieved from each granule record's `RelatedUrls` field. The download link is identified by `\"Type\": \"GET DATA\"` .\n\nSelect the download URL for each of the granule records:\n\nFinish by downloading the files to the data directory in a loop. Overwrite `.update` with a new timestamp on success.\n\nIf there were updates to the local time series during this run and no exceptions were raised during the download loop, then overwrite the timestamp file that tracks updates to the data folder (`resources/nrt/.update`):\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../../include-files.lua","quarto"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Access_Sentinel6_NRT.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":{"light":["cosmo","theme.scss"],"dark":["cosmo","theme-dark.scss"]},"code-copy":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
