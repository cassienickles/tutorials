Please visit https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov to register for an Earthdata Login account. It is free to create and only takes a moment to set up.\n\nYou will also need a netrc file containing your NASA Earthdata Login credentials in order to execute this notebook. A netrc file can be created manually within text editor and saved to your home directory. For additional information see: [Authentication for NASA Earthdata](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/tutorials/04_NASA_Earthdata_Authentication.html#authentication-via-netrc-file).\n\n### Find a granule for subsetting\n\nBelow we call out a specific granule (G2524986524-POCLOUD) on which we will use the podaac L2 subsetter. Finding this information would complicate the tutorial- but po.daac has a tutorial available for using the CMR API to find collections and granules of interest. Please see [this tutorial](https://github.com/podaac/tutorials/blob/master/notebooks/podaac_cmr_tutorial.ipynb) for that information.\n\n\n##  Subset of a PO.DAAC Granule\n\nWe can now build onto the root URL in order to actually perform a transformation.  The first transformation is a subset of a selected granule.  _At this time, this requires discovering the granule id from CMR_.  That information can then be appended to the root URL and used to call Harmony with the help of the `request` library.\n\nAbove we show how to find a granule id for processing.\n\n**Notes:**\n  The L2 subsetter current streams the data back to the user, and does not stage data in S3 for redirects. This is functionality we will be adding over time.\n  It doesn't work with URS backed files, which is coming in the next few weeks\n  it only works on the show dataset, but \n    \n\n## Verify the subsetting worked\n\nBounds used were: \n\n  'lat': '(-45.75:45)',\n  'lon': '(-90:90)'\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../../include-files.lua","quarto"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Harmony L2 Subsetter.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":{"light":["cosmo","theme.scss"],"dark":["cosmo","theme-dark.scss"]},"code-copy":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
