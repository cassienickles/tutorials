Please visit https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov to register for an Earthdata Login account. It is free to create and only takes a moment to set up.\n\nYou will also need a netrc file containing your NASA Earthdata Login credentials in order to execute this notebook. A netrc file can be created manually within text editor and saved to your home directory. For additional information see: [Authentication for NASA Earthdata](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/tutorials/04_NASA_Earthdata_Authentication.html#authentication-via-netrc-file) \n\nIn this notebook, we will be calling the authentication in the below cell, a work around if you do not yet have a netrc file.\n\n### Search Common Metadata Repository (CMR) for SWOT sample data links by Shapefile\nWe want to find the SWOT sample files that will cross over our region of interest. For this tutorial, we use a shapefile of the United States, finding 44 total granules. Each dataset has it's own unique collection ID. For the SWOT_SIMULATED_NA_CONTINENT_L2_HR_RIVERSP_V1 dataset, we can find the collection ID [here](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SWOT_SIMULATED_NA_CONTINENT_L2_HR_RIVERSP_V1).\n\n### Get Download links from CMR search results\n\n### Download the Data into a folder\n\n### Unzip shapefiles in existing folder\n\n### Merging two seperate shapefiles into one\n\n### Merging multiple shapefiles from within a folder\n\n### Converting to CSV\n\nConverting merged geodataframe into a csv file. \n\n### Querying a Shapefile\n\nIf you want to search for a specific reach id or a specific length of river reach that is possible through a spatial query using Geopandas. \n\nUtilizing comparison operators (>, <, ==, >=, <=).\n\nYou can zoom into a particular river reach by specifying by itâ€™s reach_id or looking for duplicate overlapping river reaches.\n\n### Converting to CSV\n\nConverting querried variable into a csv file.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../../include-files.lua","quarto"],"toc":true,"output-file":"SWOTsample_CSVconversion.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":{"light":"cosmo","dark":"darkly"},"code-copy":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
