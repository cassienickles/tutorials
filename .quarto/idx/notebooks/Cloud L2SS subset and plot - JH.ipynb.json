Please visit https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov to register for an Earthdata Login account. It is free to create and only takes a moment to set up.\n\nYou will also need a netrc file containing your NASA Earthdata Login credentials in order to execute this notebook. A netrc file can be created manually within text editor and saved to your home directory. For additional information see: [Authentication for NASA Earthdata](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/tutorials/04_NASA_Earthdata_Authentication.html#authentication-via-netrc-file).\n\n### Learning Objective: \n- Subset a specific file/granule that has already been found using the podaac L2 subsetter\n\n\n##  Subset of a PO.DAAC Granule\n\nWe build onto the root URL in order to actually perform a transformation.  The first transformation is a subset of a selected granule.  _At this time, this requires discovering the granule id from CMR_.  That information can then be appended to the root URL and used to call Harmony with the help of the `request` library.\n\n**Notes:**\n  The L2 subsetter current streams the data back to the user, and does not stage data in S3 for redirects. This is functionality we will be adding over time.\n  \nCreate a Harmony-py client\n\nWith the client created, we can contruct and validate the request. As this is a subsetting + concatenation request, we specify options on the request that define spatial bounds, variables we are interested in, temporal bounds, and indicated the result should be concatenated.\n\nNow that we have a valid request we simply need to call the `submit` function using the client we created earlier and pass in the request as a parameter.\n\n_Tip:_ if you want to see the request before submitting it, use the `request_as_curl` function on the client to get an equivalent curl command for the request that will be submitted.\n\n## Verify the subsetting worked\n\nBounds are defined earlier \n\n\n## Plot swath onto a map\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../include-files.lua","quarto"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Cloud L2SS subset and plot - JH.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":{"light":"cosmo","dark":"darkly"},"code-copy":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
