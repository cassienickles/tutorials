Please visit https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov to register for an Earthdata Login account. It is free to create and only takes a moment to set up.\n\nYou will also need a netrc file containing your NASA Earthdata Login credentials in order to execute this notebook. A netrc file can be created manually within text editor and saved to your home directory. For additional information see: [Authentication for NASA Earthdata](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/tutorials/04_NASA_Earthdata_Authentication.html#authentication-via-netrc-file).\n\n## Build the EOSS Root URL\n\nNext we will build a URL for the EOSS service for a given granule.  To get data using the service, you need \na [CMR](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov) collection ID for a supported collection and the ID of a\ngranule within that collection.\n\nBy convention, all Harmony services are accessed through `<harmony_root>/<collection_id>/<service_name>`\n\n## Variable Subset of a Granule\n\nWe can now build onto the root URL in order to actually perform a transformation.  The first transformation is a variable subset of a selected granule.  _At this time, this requires discovering the granule id and variable id from CMR_.  That information can then be appended to the root URL and used to call Harmony with the help of the `request` library.\n\nHarmony stages transformed data in S3 to make it easy to do additional processing in the cloud. The response that Harmony returns is actually a redirect to the S3 location where your data is staged.  Should you call Harmony in a tool that follows redirects, like your web browser, your file will be seamlessly downloaded locally for you.  However, should you desire to do additional processing in AWS, you have that option as well by simply looking at the redirected URL.  The code snippet below uses \"geturl()\" to show the URL of your staged data.\n\n## Add on a spatial subset\n\nThe second transformation is a spatial subset of a selected granule. This can be combined with the request we already built above by simply specifying a bounding box.\n\n## Reprojection\n\nThe third transformation is a reprojection of the data. This can be combined with the requests we already built above by simply specifying a coordinate reference system.  Coordinate reference systems are identified by a common name, EPSG code, or URI. Today, this is based on reference systems supported by gdal. Examples include: 'CRS:84', 'EPSG:32611'.\n\n## Reformatting\n\nNext is a reformatting of the output file of the data. This can be combined with the requests we already built above by simply specifying a format.  Examples include: image/tiff', 'image/png'\n\n## Continue Exploring\n\nHarmony's specification is available online.
